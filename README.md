Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy™ HD
-------------------------------

An unofficial mod that updates and enhances the legibility of this underrated classic
—published in 2003 for the _GameCube_, _PlayStation 2_ and _Xbox_ platforms— while respecting
its venerable original artwork and stylistic choices.

Developed as a texture pack for the Dolphin emulator, targeting its European (PAL) release.
